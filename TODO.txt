base health regeneration rate
	food acts as buff items, for this, and/or other things
	maybe, after recieving damage, stop regneration for a bit
		could be spunn of into it's own stat tbh

Gamemode: teleportitis diseas
	every minite (randomized) of so the player gets teleported to a random location [in a radius?]
	foods/consumables/altar blesings/whatever,
		to prolong the time to teleport
		limit it's distance
		bias it's destination?
	goal is to cure the diseas

infusions, a way to handle player buffs
	basically instead of potions you 'infuse' your soul? with effects like speed
	jump boost, slowfall, resistance, glowing, more hp, double jump? blink(short range teleport)
	if I can figure out a controll scheme, flight
	ok, maybe this needs to be split into two types for passives and actives
	limited infustion "slots", players must choose their prefered loadout

tape measure - punch two positions so it tells you the distance

just stright up no sticks, like terraria

trophies - bronze, silver, gold

player model statues
	half the size of the player, so standing up they are 1 node tall
	various positions - standing, sitting, laying down, etc

stool, for sitting

Can you use forspec prepend to add custom buttons to the Esc menu?

infinnite tool durability, but the durability bar is repurposed to be tool sharpness ("condition")
	decreasing sharpness decreases tool dig speed
	5 stages - they appear in item description as "Condition: " .. new/worn/damaged/shabby/broken

Hud when hovering over chests/furnaces dispalying their content

terraria style hammer for changing node shapes in world, no extra crafting necessary

cassava, "brown" tuber

"roomba" which does grass cutting, land plowing, farming?

keeping track of loaded blocks: https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?p=429505#p429505

stairs, slabs, etc ... are 1 to 1, 1 full node crafts to 1 slab crafts to 1 stair. no messing with ratios

inventory textures for glowing_air
a setting which when true, invisible nodes will have a texture

game simmilar to decked out
	a way to defeat the beasts, might even be the main objective
	sneak around to complete tasks and find required items to defeat them
		the goal is to slay a specific beast, but you can also hunt the others to clear the way and get some bonus reward

instead of items despawning, they turn into a "pile of items" node

creative:
	creative inventory
	immediate node digging
	infinite stacks
	no excesive node drops
	creative priv

creative should have silk touch by default

ingame way to increase hotbar size

storage containers should have buttons for:
	take all
	deposit all
	deposit already present

moss that grows in the underground
when exposed to sunlight it turns into dry moss
dry moss can be used as fuel?

worldgen teleporters ala vintage story translocator
	all teleporter locations of the world are predetermined from the start
	when one is used for the first time it is linked up with a random other one

little to no empty plains, if a forest can exist there a forest shall exist there

grass/shrubs with 'move_resistance'

different item name colors for: tools, craftitems, food, nodes, etc

ore vein generation:
	select start position
	find all neighboring nodes
	select one of the neighbor position
		add all its neightbors to the pool of potential next ore positions
	repeat



group:airlike for nodes which are invisible, unwalkablable, and generally can be treated like air

have flatbread instead of bread

have the player character do idle animations/sit down/etc... when the player is afk

decals as described here: https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=29548&p=425842#p425842

a game/map focused on exploration (and adventure (and puzzles))
	throughout the map there are shrines
	the player has only a limited time to live
	touching the shrines resets the timer
	in the map there are colectibles which
		increase the timer
		make the player move faster
	?locked door whch cost time to open?
	hidden/unlockable shortcuts
	secret shrines also exist

	somewhere close to the begining is a long path that the player needs to take
	but won't be able to until they get a bunch of upgrades

have groups like: group:material_iron, group:material_wood, group:material_steel, etc...
	- group:category_tool, group:category_(food/consumable?), group:category_ ...

herbs which only spawn around a particular feature, like a specific rock or such

resource crop/mystical agriculture style mode, but some resource required for the process (suitable soil maybe) is limited to mapgen only, so it isn't so exponential

dungeon mode:
	can I detect where things are and open a formspec button on the correct screen location?


after harvesting a plant the node under it has a chance to become untilled

chest that looks like something completely unexpected to have an inventory

plant which ony grows when no one is watching (the area it's in is not loaded)

checkout 'connect_sides' feature of nodeboxes, maybe it will help with lanter fence interaction?

when a ladder is rightclicked with another ladder the existing ladder gets extended up/down depending on player looking angle

different enemy type/behaviour in different parts of the word



MOD: posable_objects, think minecraft aromor stands, but the object can have whatever visual/mesh/textures the player wants

a way to carry spawner nodes, but the spawner continues working while being carried

storage node where the player can determine number of inv slots

glass with dark edges as default

one of the ways in which tools can improve is range!

farmable plants which grow sidways on blocks (+ sidways 'farmland')

is it possible to fix bad hud bar scaling by reading the player settings?

instead of a caried torch. do a terraria style light pet

torches are temporary, BUT there is a resource which can be farmed relatively easily which gives permanent light

colorcode item category in descriptions; food, fuel, ore/metal, tool, buildingblock, etc...

"thing is, turtles(robots) are supper lazy and stop working when nobody is close enough to watch them"

think about normal play like building set pieces for rouglike game?

an ore that only spawns in surface mountains

its impossible to safely override ores since thier registration order matters but is not retrievable

calling get_string with empty key returns table?

make a time stop mod
	command to enable, disable it
	settings:
		enabled, wheter it's enabled
		time, at which day time time is frozen


see how well inventory lists work in a scroll container
	container takes scroll precednece, making it impossible to scroll the items

concept idea for a game,
	the player doesn't get the node they dig, they only get the resources
	no crafting, at least for building blocks
	when the player want's to place a bed, they select it from a catalog (creative style inventory ?)
		placing the bed (the bed item doesn't get consumed) costs 3 textile resources and 3 wood resources
		digging the bed yeilds back the invested resources (if that's desired)
	a dimension of depth can be gained from having to unlock the placeable nodes

the glowing air everywhere thing just isn't working out.. on the surface that is, underground it seems to work fine
	as the player moves down the move through a realy dark layer with dark stone
	then suddenly there comes a point where a lot of glowdust ore is spread around and the glow air starts
	the very high density doesn't last very long( maybe some 20 - 50 nodes?, depends on other heights)
		and as an aside, don't use depth as a mesure of game progress you idiots
		if you need to slow the player down, find other mechanics
	after that the glow dust ore is present in much humbler quantities (all the way down until there is a erason to stop)
	and the glow air effect remains
	material shimmer


a wand which uses arx fatalis like casting to select spells, though the shape spell asocation is up to the user
 spells in full are defined in the players spell book, but the player can decide which gesture casts which spels


turnbased rouglike where the player moves by selecting one of the adjenced nodes
  free movement while not in combat


monster which causes darkness around itself
  places airlike nodes which dont let light through themsleves

phoenix tree
	grows -> undergoes slow necrosis -> catches fire and burns down -> the tree core automaticaly plants itself as a sapling

fireing kiln - has several slots, but only accepts stacks of 1 and results stay in same slot

The sun and moon are just two gigantic eyeballs. No explenation.

energy based smelting
	use kelvin? - temerature
	and Joules - energy
	watt? - energy trasfer speed
	default temperature 15 C?
	fuel
		- amount of energy which can be released by burning
		- amount of energy it releases per second
	furnaces
		- have a rate at which they loose acumulated temperature energy, limmiting their max temperature
	smeltables/cookables
		- energy capacity - energy needed to increase in temperature
		- can't reach higher temperature then the furnace
	recipes
		-triger when certain temperature reached

	storage node in which items specifically don't/very slowly loose their temperature


add it to official lore that time moves only when an area is observed i.e. the payer is near

material that cannot be destroyed/moved, but is necessary to be present for whatever


potion which reveals nearby ores - see resonator mod

general idea = mapgen where the player is trapped in an internal structure

for dungeons - braziers and similar that the player can light up, see 'unepic'

replace all air with glowing air

respawn anchor - node at which you can set your spawn point, for a price
	- when mined (only valid tool is hand) moves one node in the direction it is being punched
		- tool doesn't have to be hand necesarily, but it must always be a constant time, regardless of tech level, that is realtively slow, so it isn't too easy to cary them away
		- can be pushed up slopes
		- can be pushed into any node that is buildable_to
	- gravity afected
		- make sure it is never ever droped as an item
	- spawns randomly in the world
	configuration options:
		- price for setting your respawn point - consider this further
			- just specifying a single item seems like it's too unflexible
			- maybe in code have a condition function for wether it respawn can be set
			  and the settings menu is just a simple override for non-modders
		- how often you can respawn at the given anchor
			- negative/zero for infinite respawns


collision_box es don't support type = "regular"

a 'stoor to nearby chests' button - done, now improve it
	like the one in terraria

a node which can only be mined when next to another node
	selction boxes have all the capabilitis of node boxes, including conectivity
	ghost ore

elementars
	fire elementar
		spawns when a lot of fire accumulates in one place
		throws fireballs which spreads the fire
		when killed, fire in a surounding radius dies out

	sand elementar
		whirlwind
		stays in a small area around spawning pos
		throws projectiles

	stone elementar
		is a stone elementar


if a lantern doesn't protect from wind then the flame may flicker, the faster the player moves the greater the chance that it goes out
	stopping lets the flame recover


?make trees grow over time

if mature farmed plants are left standing for too long they die/whiter/etc
	consider: this makes it hard to do large fields for aesthetics

equivalent to player_monoids
	first evaluate +- then */

warry walking speed depending on what the player is standing on

figure out what this means: Nodes are now allowed to have the "liquid" or "flowingliquid" drawtype for non-liquids (liquidtype=none)

replace craosshairs with ones with better visibility against dark/bright backgrounds

a group which signifies that time should be simulated for that node after it is loaded again
+ the actual mechanics of it

"instead of making leaves nonexistent in the winter, just re-texture them as branches with no leaves. then you won't have any leaf respawning troubles."

sufocation from water

get rid of sfinv and creative

add water chestnut to marches

geode - blob ore with a smaler blob ore inside
	the outer one acts as a barier for the valuable material inside
	minetest automatically offsets the ore seeds so best bet is generating geode completely manually

Slow but powerfull enemies, focus on mechanics not direct hitting

ore generation

wind affecting players movement as a barier preventing the player from reaching a location

?in-between space before respawn
yeah, adding a differnet place for thep layer after death could add a lot
definitively a shakeup of the usual patern (this is good)

?robot mod, use abms to consistently time actions
	works only if robot is a node, not an entity
	seems like timers also work ok

distinct stick and tool rod

maybe try something like unstable ingots as training for an eventual AIM mod

To make a brick block place individual bricks one afer another into a node and then add mortar, on mining returns loose bricks

kill the player if they stay too long in complete darknes
	provide warning signs
	"You have been eaten by a ..."

hunger and thirst
	comunicated through warning signs, not directly displayed - might be to frustrating
	penaties for too hight/low bar fullness
	soft cap, hard cap
	if you stuff yourself over the hard cap with food you puke most of it out

	stomach capacity
	each food has a value how much it is
	foods get digested over time
	can have effect as ling as they are in the stomach

Cooking stone
	place over fire
	needs to be supported on both ends to be placable
		ends just a bit into the adjenced nodes
	cooking food as an entity on the stone?


Dungeon
	3*5*3 node tilles
	randomly choose between stone/cobble
	each depth level uses another stone type
	keys and matching doors
	fake walls
	floor modifiers? - plantlife/water/fire/whatever

	enemies
		ball which rolls straight towards the player until it hits something, stops, turns towards the player, and rolls again
		stationary turret

Random stuff:
	doodle god game?
	'modular portals' game portals are interesting(the dialing)
	carcassone game
=====
DONE:
=====
die - when placed it comes up with a random number on top

mapgen distortion - before getting the noise offset the queried possition into some direction
this might hopefully help disguise the perlin

branches for all tree types

cart
	rightclick - opens inventory
	shift + rightclick begin/stop pulling it
	while pulling, decrease movement speed and prevent jumping

trees
	make tree trunks grow through leaf blocks

leaves
	-_grows_on
	-change back from nodetimer to custom activation

ropes made out of grass

caves
	-make largesacale cave density varry with a perlin noise
	-also do something about cave diameter at some point

lantern mod
	viz Piezos_ illumination, but done with nodetimers
	has own inventory slot
	some upgradet for of lantern that bahaves like this mod: https://content.minetest.net/packages/Hybrid%20Dog/cave_lighting/

cavegen mod
	-select two random points within each chunk, connect them with a cave,
		generate two poins for each touching chunk and conect the closest points
		from each

arrows drawn with coal

random path conecting two positions

_on_update() for leaves
	- maybe with nodetimers to schedule an update
	--turned out to be suprisingly simple, the main issue was bad code for change detection

torches which compleately burn down

chiselable stones
	- adds 21 variants per block

slabs mod
	- lol chisel mod prety-much replaces it

crates
	- 4 * 4 slots


=====
OTHER
=====
enchanting
	don't enchant items directly, instead create an item which holds the enchantment
	(like MC enchanted book) but only one at lowest level of strenght
	that can be made storonger

	once enchantment is placed on tool it can't be changed

	provide a use for enchantments wich are left over

	different tools have a diffreent capacity to hold enchantments

=====
MAYBE
=====

ladders have gravity and can only be stacked up to x high every so often the
player has to place an afixed ladder, which is naturally harder to craft
