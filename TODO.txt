replace all air with glowing air

respawn anchor - node at which you can set your spawn point, for a price
		- has to be paid after every death?
	- when mined (only valid tool is hand) moves one node in the direction it is being punched
		- can be pushed up slopes
	- spawns randomly in the world

collision_box es don't support type = "regular"

a 'stoor to nearby chests' button
	like the one in terraria

a node which can only be mined when next to another node
	selction boxes have all the capabilitis of node boxes, including conectivity

elementars
	fire elementar
		spawns when a lot of fire accumulates in one place
		throws fireballs which spreads the fire
		when killed, fire in a surounding radius dies out

	sand elementar
		whirlwind
		stays in a small area around spawning pos
		throws projectiles

	stone elementar
		is a stone elementar


if a lantern doesn't protect from wind then the flame may flicker, the faster the player moves the greater the chance that it goes out
	stopping lets the flame recover


?make trees grow over time

if mature farmed plants are left standing for too long they die/whiter/etc

equivalent to player_monoids
	first evaluate +- then */

warry walking speed depending on what the player is standing on

figure out what this means: Nodes are now allowed to have the "liquid" or "flowingliquid" drawtype for non-liquids (liquidtype=none)

replace craosshairs with ones with better visibility against dark/bright backgrounds

a group which signifies that time should be simulated for that node after it is loaded again
+ the actual mechanics of it

"instead of making leaves nonexistent in the winter, just re-texture them as branches with no leaves. then you won't have any leaf respawning troubles."

sufocation from water

get rid of sfinv and creative

add water chestnut to marches

geode - blob ore with a smaler blob ore inside
	the outer one acts as a barier for the valuable material inside

Slow but powerfull enemies, focus on mechanics not direct hitting

ore generation

wind affecting players movement as a barier preventing the player from reaching a location

?in-between space before respawn

?robot mod, use abms to consistently time actions
	works only if robot is a node, not an entity
	seems like timers also work ok

distinct stick and tool rod

maybe try something like unstable ingots as training for an eventual AIM mod

To make a brick block place individual bricks one afer another into a node and then add mortar, on mining returns loose bricks

kill the player if they stay too long in complete darknes
	provide warning signs
	"You have been eaten by a ..."

hunger and thirst
	comunicated through warning signs, not directly displayed - might be to frustrating
	penaties for too hight/low bar fullness
	soft cap, hard cap
	if you stuff yourself over the hard cap with food you puke most of it out

	stomach capacity
	each food has a value how much it is
	foods get digested over time
	can have effect as ling as they are in the stomach

Cooking stone
	place over fire
	needs to be supported on both ends to be placable
		ends just a bit into the adjenced nodes
	cooking food as an entity on the stone?


Dungeon
	3*5*3 node tilles
	randomly choose between stone/cobble
	each depth level uses another stone type
	keys and matching doors
	fake walls
	floor modifiers? - plantlife/water/fire/whatever

DONE:
=====
cart
	rightclick - opens inventory
	shift + rightclick begin/stop pulling it
	while pulling decrease movement speed and prevent jumping

trees
	make tree trunks grow through leaf blocks

leaves
	-_grows_on
	-change back from nodetimer to custom activation

ropes made out of grass

caves
	-make largesacale cave density varry with a perlin noise
	-also do something about cave diameter at some point

lantern mod
	viz Piezos_ illumination, but done with nodetimers
	has own inventory slot
	some upgradet for of lantern that bahaves like this mod: https://content.minetest.net/packages/Hybrid%20Dog/cave_lighting/

cavegen mod
	-select two random points within each chunk, connect them with a cave,
		generate two poins for each touching chunk and conect the closest points
		from each

arrows drawn with coal

random path conecting two positions

_on_update() for leaves
	- maybe with nodetimers to schedule an update
	--turned out to be suprisingly simple, the main issue was bad code for change detection

torches which compleately burn down

chiselable stones
	- adds 21 variants per block

slabs mod
	- lol chisel mod prety-much replaces it

crates
	- 4 * 4 slots


=====
OTHER
=====
enchanting
	don't enchant items directly, instead create an item which holds the enchantment
	(like MC enchanted book) but only one at lowest level of strenght
	that can be made storonger

	once enchantment is placed on tool it can't be changed

	provide a use for enchantments wich are left over

	different tools have a diffreent capacity to hold enchantments

=====
MAYBE
=====

ladders have gravity and can only be stacked up to x high every so often the
player has to place an afixed ladder, which is naturally harder to craft
