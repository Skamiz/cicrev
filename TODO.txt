make tree trunks grow through leaf blocks
?something so construction isn't instant

if mature farmed plants are left standing for too long they die/whiter/etc

equivalent to player_monoids
	first evaluate +- then */

warry walking speed depending on what the player is standing on

figure out what this means: Nodes are now allowed to have the "liquid" or "flowingliquid" drawtype for non-liquids (liquidtype=none)

replace craosshairs with ones with better visibility against dark/bright backgrounds

a group which signifies that time should be simulated for that node after it is loaded again

"instead of making leaves nonexistent in the winter, just re-texture them as branches with no leaves. then you won't have any leaf respawning troubles."

sufocation from water

get rid of sfinv and creative

add water chestnut to marches

geode - blob ore with a smaler blob ore inside
	the outer one acts as a barier for the valuable material inside

Slow but powerfull enemies, focus on mechanics not direct hitting

ore generation

wind affectin players movement as a barier preventing the player from reaching a location

?in-between space before respawn

?robot mod, use abms to consistently time actions
	works only if robot is a node, not an entity
	seems like timers also work ok

distinct stick and tool rod

maybe try something like unstable ingots as training for an eventual AIM mod

To make a brick block place individual bricks one afer another into a node and then add mortar, on mining returns loose bricks

kill the player if they stay too long in complete darknes
	provide warning signs
	"You have been eaten by a ..."

hunger and thirst
	comunicated through warning signs, not directly displayed - might be to frustrating
	penaties for too hight/low bar fullness
	soft cap, hard cap
	if you stuff yourself over the hard cap with food you puke most of it out

	stomach capacity
	each food has a value how much it is
	foods get digested over time
	can have effect as ling as they are in the stomach

Cooking stone
	place over fire
	needs to be supported on both ends to be placable
		ends just a bit into the adjenced nodes

	shift + rightclick begin/stop pulling it
	while pulling decrease movement speed and prevent jumping

leaves

ropes made out of grass

caves
	-make largesacale cave density varry with a perlin noise
	-also do something about cave diameter at some point

lantern mod
	viz Piezos_ illumination, but done with nodetimers
	has own inventory slot

cavegen mod
	-select two random points within each chunk, connect them with a cave,
		generate two poins for each touching chunk and conect the closest points
		from each

arrows drawn with coal

random path conecting two positions

_on_update() for leaves
	- maybe with nodetimers to schedule an update
	--turned out to be suprisingly simple, the main issue was bad code for change detection

torches which compleately burn down

chiselable stones
	- adds 21 variants per block

slabs mod
	- lol chisel mod prety-much replaces it

crates
	- 4 * 4 slots
