TODO:
=====
a wand which uses arx fatalis like casting to select spells, though the shape spell asocation is up to the user
 spells in full are defined in the players spell book, but the player can decide which gesture casts which spels


turnbased rouglike where the player moves by selecting one of the adjenced nodes
  free movement while not in combat


monster which causes darkness around itself
  places airlike nodes which dont let light through themsleves

phoenix tree
	grows -> undergoes slow necrosis -> catches fire and burns down -> the tree core automaticaly plants itself as a sapling

fireing kiln - has several slots, but only accepts stacks of 1 and results stay in same slot

The sun and moon are just two gigantic eyeballs. No explenation.

energy based smelting
	use kelvin? - temerature
	and Joules - energy
	watt? - energy trasfer speed
	default temperature 15 C?
	fuel
		- amount of energy which can be released by burning
		- amount of energy it releases per second
	furnaces
		- have a rate at which they loose acumulated temperature energy, limmiting their max temperature
	smeltables/cookables
		- energy capacity - energy needed to increase in temperature
		- can't reach higher temperature then the furnace
	recipes
		-triger when certain temperature reached

	storage node in which items specifically don't/very slowly loose their temperature


add it to official lore that time moves only when an area is observed i.e. the payer is near

material that cannot be destroyed/moved, but is necessary to be present for whatever


potion which reveals nearby ores - see resonator mod

general idea = mapgen where the player is trapped in an internal structure

for dungeons - braziers and similar that the player can light up, see 'unepic'

replace all air with glowing air

respawn anchor - node at which you can set your spawn point, for a price
		- has to be paid after every death?
	- when mined (only valid tool is hand) moves one node in the direction it is being punched
		- can be pushed up slopes
	- spawns randomly in the world

collision_box es don't support type = "regular"

a 'stoor to nearby chests' button - done, now improve it
	like the one in terraria

a node which can only be mined when next to another node
	selction boxes have all the capabilitis of node boxes, including conectivity
	ghost ore

elementars
	fire elementar
		spawns when a lot of fire accumulates in one place
		throws fireballs which spreads the fire
		when killed, fire in a surounding radius dies out

	sand elementar
		whirlwind
		stays in a small area around spawning pos
		throws projectiles

	stone elementar
		is a stone elementar


if a lantern doesn't protect from wind then the flame may flicker, the faster the player moves the greater the chance that it goes out
	stopping lets the flame recover


?make trees grow over time

if mature farmed plants are left standing for too long they die/whiter/etc

equivalent to player_monoids
	first evaluate +- then */

warry walking speed depending on what the player is standing on

figure out what this means: Nodes are now allowed to have the "liquid" or "flowingliquid" drawtype for non-liquids (liquidtype=none)

replace craosshairs with ones with better visibility against dark/bright backgrounds

a group which signifies that time should be simulated for that node after it is loaded again
+ the actual mechanics of it

"instead of making leaves nonexistent in the winter, just re-texture them as branches with no leaves. then you won't have any leaf respawning troubles."

sufocation from water

get rid of sfinv and creative

add water chestnut to marches

geode - blob ore with a smaler blob ore inside
	the outer one acts as a barier for the valuable material inside
	minetest automatically offsets the ore seeds so best bet is generating geode completely manually

Slow but powerfull enemies, focus on mechanics not direct hitting

ore generation

wind affecting players movement as a barier preventing the player from reaching a location

?in-between space before respawn

?robot mod, use abms to consistently time actions
	works only if robot is a node, not an entity
	seems like timers also work ok

distinct stick and tool rod

maybe try something like unstable ingots as training for an eventual AIM mod

To make a brick block place individual bricks one afer another into a node and then add mortar, on mining returns loose bricks

kill the player if they stay too long in complete darknes
	provide warning signs
	"You have been eaten by a ..."

hunger and thirst
	comunicated through warning signs, not directly displayed - might be to frustrating
	penaties for too hight/low bar fullness
	soft cap, hard cap
	if you stuff yourself over the hard cap with food you puke most of it out

	stomach capacity
	each food has a value how much it is
	foods get digested over time
	can have effect as ling as they are in the stomach

Cooking stone
	place over fire
	needs to be supported on both ends to be placable
		ends just a bit into the adjenced nodes
	cooking food as an entity on the stone?


Dungeon
	3*5*3 node tilles
	randomly choose between stone/cobble
	each depth level uses another stone type
	keys and matching doors
	fake walls
	floor modifiers? - plantlife/water/fire/whatever

	enemies
		ball which rolls straight towards the player until it hits something, stops, turns towards the player, and rolls again
		stationary turret
=====
DONE:
=====
cart
	rightclick - opens inventory
	shift + rightclick begin/stop pulling it
	while pulling decrease movement speed and prevent jumping

trees
	make tree trunks grow through leaf blocks

leaves
	-_grows_on
	-change back from nodetimer to custom activation

ropes made out of grass

caves
	-make largesacale cave density varry with a perlin noise
	-also do something about cave diameter at some point

lantern mod
	viz Piezos_ illumination, but done with nodetimers
	has own inventory slot
	some upgradet for of lantern that bahaves like this mod: https://content.minetest.net/packages/Hybrid%20Dog/cave_lighting/

cavegen mod
	-select two random points within each chunk, connect them with a cave,
		generate two poins for each touching chunk and conect the closest points
		from each

arrows drawn with coal

random path conecting two positions

_on_update() for leaves
	- maybe with nodetimers to schedule an update
	--turned out to be suprisingly simple, the main issue was bad code for change detection

torches which compleately burn down

chiselable stones
	- adds 21 variants per block

slabs mod
	- lol chisel mod prety-much replaces it

crates
	- 4 * 4 slots


=====
OTHER
=====
enchanting
	don't enchant items directly, instead create an item which holds the enchantment
	(like MC enchanted book) but only one at lowest level of strenght
	that can be made storonger

	once enchantment is placed on tool it can't be changed

	provide a use for enchantments wich are left over

	different tools have a diffreent capacity to hold enchantments

=====
MAYBE
=====

ladders have gravity and can only be stacked up to x high every so often the
player has to place an afixed ladder, which is naturally harder to craft


=======
what does on_dig do:
check 'diggable'  and 'can_dig'
	if either is false return

check 'is_protected'

if wielded try 'after_use'
	else add wear
set wielded

call 'preserve_metadata'

'handle_node_drops'
